 Title: 	MULTIPLEMODEL MACHINE VISION

<paragraph>Images are fundamentally inhomogeneous, yet most machine vision work has
been based on homogeneous processing using a single type of image model.  We
have developed a framework for inhomogeneous, multiplemodel machine vision
using a Minimum Description Length (MDL)/Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
selection criterion.  I will talk about how we have applied this framework
to the problem of multipleobject structure/egomotion from uncalibrated
video, and the problem of object recognition using 2D aspect models.</paragraph>
