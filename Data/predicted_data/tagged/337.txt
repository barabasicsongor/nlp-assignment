 TITLE: The Programmable Automated Welding System

<paragraph>The trend toward manufacturing in small lot sizes continues, imposing
ever new demands on the responsiveness of companies to consumer demands.
 To be cost competitive, this requires the designer to perform part of
the manufacturing planning early in the design phase.  Towards this end
a number of decision support tools have been developed, providing
designers with vital information regarding the manufacturability of a
part or a product.  Part of any manufacturability study includes the
simulations of the processes involved.  It is important that the
designer can investigate different manufacturing scenerios and
succesfully choose one within the constraints of his organization or the
ones he can easily access.  Dr. Prinz will describe the requirements of
an environment in which a part can be designed incorparating both the
geometric and nongeometric information required for a complete
product/manufacturing process description.  </paragraph>

<paragraph>His presentation will describe the nonprocedural Programable Automated
WeldingSystem (PAWS) package.  This system has three major components,
namely, a nonmanifold solid modeler for part, equipment, and
environment definition, an SQL (Standard Query Language) compatible
database for process definition, and a robotic motion planning module
capable of motion optimization, interference detection and graphic
simulation.  Although this system focuses on the welding process, the
key components of the system are equally relevant to other manufacturing
strategies such as grinding, spraying, deburring, and cutting.</paragraph>
