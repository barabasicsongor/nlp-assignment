 TITLE:	  3DTV (and Workstations)

<paragraph>High definition, high speed displays integrated with fast digitization,
image storage, and image processing now permit us to implement several
concepts for 3Dsterescopic television (and computer workstations), many
of which have been around, unimplementable, for a long time.  In this
talk I will:</paragraph>

   review the fundamentals of binocular 3Dstereoscopic vision

   review historical approaches to 3Dimage and 3Dstream pair display

   narrow the discussion to approaches that use a single moreorless flat
     screen (like a TV or workstation monitor)

   describe my group's research in several areas:

      the physics of recreating nakedeye and augmentedeye reality

      the stateoftheart in video: delivering the full spatial and
        temporal resolution of an NTSC stream per eye

      three increasingly sophisticated approaches to presenting video
        and/or computer graphics on a workstation

         a well known special purpose hardware based fullscreen,
           half spatial resolution approach

         our adaptation of this approach to an XWindows environment,
           still full screen

         our new "StereoinWindows" approach, which allows arbitrary
           mixes of stereo and flat XWindows on one screen at one time
           at full resolution

      progress in the (I will show you: related) areas of image compression,
        intermediate view interpolation, and useradjustable stereopsis

   demonstrate as much of this as it is practical to set up in the Adamson
     Wing auditorium TBD.
