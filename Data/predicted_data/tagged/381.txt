 TITLE:	Research in Teleoperated and Cooperative Control 
 	of FreeFlying Space Robots

<paragraph>The MIT Laboratory for Space Teleoperation and Robotics (LSTAR) is involved in the study of freeflying space robotic vehicles for performing extravehicular assembly, servicing, and repair.  <sentence>LSTAR's experimental activities include both neutralbuoyancy and virtualenvironment experiments that target the humanrobot teleoperator interface, as well as cooperative, automatic control systems that work to aid the human operator. </sentence></paragraph>

<sentence>LSTAR's neutralbuoyancy robot, STAR, was designed to be serviceable, reliable, and flexible. </sentence>  <sentence>In order to support experiments combining human and automatic control, STAR is equipped with a realtime visionbased control system that has been used to demonstrate highquality realtime control of STAR's position and orientation at a simulated worksite. </sentence>  STAR has also been equipped recently with a threedegreeoffreedom manipulator arm to support 
experiments in teleoperator positioning dexterity as well as simple, autonomous fetchandreturn experiments.

<sentence>LSTAR's virtualenvironment system is designed to focus on the remotevision systems used by a remotevehicle operator to sense and control the vehicle's position and orientation in its environment. </sentence>  <sentence>It is able to simulate teleoperation of vehicles functioning in two or three dimensions, with a variety of vehicle dynamics and visual environments. </sentence>  <sentence>It supports both fixedmonitor and helmetmounted displays, with or without simulated headtracking of the remote cameras. </sentence>  Its primary current function is to 
study the use of sophisticated headtracking stereoscopic camera 
systems and helmetmounted displays, and to find ways to improve operator perception and control of vehicle motion using such systems.
