<paragraph>University Teaching Center
Seminars Series for Graduate Students
"Managing Current Courses, Anticipating Future Roles"</paragraph>

<paragraph>ABOUT THE SERIES</paragraph>

"Managing Current Courses, Anticipating Future Roles" is a weekly series of
interactive seminars designed for graduate students.  On a pilot basis for
199394, the Teaching Center will offer several  indepth, threeweek
modules and several onesession special topics on different aspects of
college teaching and learning.  

<paragraph>The modules provide an opportunity for sustained discussion of selected
topics because we ask you to make a commitment to attend 3 or 4 related
sessions.  This format allows you to try some different strategies and then
discuss how they worked with other participants.  Also, for some modules we
may ask you to bring some sample materials from your discipline so that the
applications can be most useful to you.  The special topic format allows you
to sample a combination of topics based on your interest in different types
of students, course formats, or teaching styles.  </paragraph>

<paragraph>To facilitate discussion each session will have no more than 20
participants.  Some of the sessions may break into smaller groups to
accommodate the interests of people in different disciplines.  Experienced
TAs, faculty, and administrators will be present to facilitate discussion at
several sessions.  </paragraph>

<paragraph>You should preregister for sessions of interest to you by using the form
included in this program description, or by contacting Michelle
GreggRassau, at x2896 or mg2e@andrew.cmu.edu.  Please note that the
locations for Spring 1994 seminars will be announced at a later date.  If
you have questions about these seminars,  please contact Rea Freeland,
Associate Director, at x7981 or rf51@andrew.cmu.edu.   </paragraph>
