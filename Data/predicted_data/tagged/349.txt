Assembly problems arise when a robot with relatively few degrees of actuated
freedom is assigned to manipulate an environment with relatively  many
degrees of unactuated freedom. This talk reviews our progress in the
effort to pose and solve classes of such problems within a framework of
"autonomous machine design" that emphasizes the dynamical nature of
robot tasks and environments.
