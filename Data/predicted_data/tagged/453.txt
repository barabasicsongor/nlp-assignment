<paragraph>Future parallel computers must execute efficiently both handcoded
applications and also programs written in highlevel programming
languages.  Today's machines limit programs to a single communication
paradigmmessagepassing or sharedmemorywhich results in uneven
performance.  To address this problem, we have developed the Tempest
interface, which supports sharedmemory, messagepassing, and hybrid
applications.  Tempest enhances portability of parallel programs by
allowing lowcost networks of workstations to provide the same
abstractions (e.g., shared memory) as highperformance parallel
machines.</paragraph>

<paragraph>The Tempest interface consists of lowlevel communication and
memorysystem mechanisms.  Policies, such as shared memory, are
implemented in userlevel software, which allows programmers and
compilers to customize policies to an application's semantics and
sharing patterns.  Experiments show that custom cache coherency
policies can produce upto an orderofmagnitude performance
improvement.</paragraph>

<sentence>We have completed two implementations of the Tempest interface. </sentence>
Typhoon illustrates the performance of firstclass hardware support
for Tempest.  This proposed hardware system implements Tempest using a
fullyprogrammable, userlevel processor in the network interface.
Blizzard demonstrates Tempest's portability by implementing the
interface in software running on stock hardware (a Thinking Machines
CM5).  We are currently developing a third Tempest implementation by
porting Blizzard to the Wisconsin COW (Cluster Of Workstations).

<paragraph>This work is part of the Wisconsin Wind Tunnel project, coled by
Mark Hill, James Larus, and David Wood.</paragraph>
