 Title: 	Green Engineering: Rethinking Engineering Design And  
 	Manufacturing From The Environmental Perspective.

<paragraph>Green Engineering is an approach to product and process design that
achieves environmental friendliness without compromising a product's quality or its commercial viability.  <sentence>The implications of green engineering are far reaching. </sentence> <sentence>Product design has to now include issues relating to disposal and reuse. </sentence> <sentence>Manufacturing has to include disassembly and remanufacture (demanufacturing). </sentence> <sentence>Economic planning has to include revenues from post consumer marketing. </sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph>Over the past two decades, a lot of research and effort has been put
into understanding issues such as waste management and materials recovery, as they relate to products after they enter the waste stream.  <sentence>Attention is now being focussed on the product design. </sentence>  <sentence>Our idea is to inject concerns about environmental friendliness into the design process, where, the assessment of environmental friendliness is based on a lifecycle view of the product. </sentence>  <sentence>This includes the product's manufacturing process, distribution, use, and final disposal. </sentence></paragraph>

<sentence>This talk provides an overview of the "Design for Environment" effort at CMU. </sentence> <sentence>Including the role of robotics, CAD tools and environmental analysis. </sentence> <sentence>This research grew out of work in traditional concurrent engineering and was called the Green Engineering Project in 1989. </sentence>  <sentence>The project has concentrated on the engineering and economic issues of being environmentally compatible. </sentence>
