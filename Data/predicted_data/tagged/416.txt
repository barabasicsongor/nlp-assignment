<paragraph>BestFirst Minimax: A Selective Search Algorithm for TwoPlayer Games

<paragraph>We present a very simple selective minimax search algorithm for twoplayer
games. It always expands next the frontier node at the end of the principal
variation, or current best line of play, which is the node that determines the
minimax value of the root. The algorithm requires no information other than a
static evaluation function, and its time overhead per node is similar to that
of alphabeta minimax.  On random game trees, our algorithm outperforms an
efficient implementation of alphabeta, giving both the same amount of
computation.  In the game of Othello, using the evaluation function from Bill,
the world's best program, bestfirst minimax also outplays alphabeta.  We
present an implementation of the algorithm that reduces its space complexity
from exponential to linear in the search depth, at the cost of increased time
complexity.  Finally, we present a hybrid bestfirst extension algorithm that
combines alphabeta and bestfirst minimax, and performs significantly better
than either pure algorithm in both domains.</paragraph>
