<paragraph>This talk describes an environment to derive efficient parallel
implementations from program specifications using stepwise 
refinement.  The environment is built around a data parallel
notation called UC.  Novel aspects of UC include:</paragraph>

 support for the design of rapid prototypes 
 incremental refinements for efficiency via dynamic data 
  distributions and progressively weaker synchronizations
 portability across synchronous and asynchronous architectures
 simple controlflow constructs to ensure that correctness 
  proofs are no more complicated than for equivalent 
  sequential programs.

<paragraph>A UC compiler is available for the CM2; a sequential emulator 
for UC is also available and a multicomputer implementation 
is in progress.  Measurements of the UC compiler on selected 
numerical and graph applications will be presented.</paragraph>
