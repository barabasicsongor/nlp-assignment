ARGUMENT AND ARBITRATION GAMES</paragraph>

<paragraph>We begin with two points about modeling reasoning that Herbert Simon
and Nicholas Rescher made well, but which were lost in the AI shuffle:
1) rational belief can be constructed by the right kind of
resourcebounded process; 2) dialectic is one of the right kinds of
process.  A protocol for disputation is essentially a model of an
automated reasoner's search procedure.</paragraph>

<paragraph>We describe programs and card games which model casebased legal
argument and reasoned settlement.</paragraph>
