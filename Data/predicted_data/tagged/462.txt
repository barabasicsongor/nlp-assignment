                    Interconnect Analysis via Passive Circuit Synthesis

	Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in the creation of
loworder models to represent the behavior of linear interconnect
circuits. Through approaches such as asymptotic waveform evaluation
(AWE) and Pade' approximation, it is possible to efficiently compute a
simple macromodel of a complicated interconnect. This macromodel can be
combined with nonlinear driver and receiver models to accelerate the
analysis of the circuit's responses.

	One problem with Pade' approximation is that it may generate unstable
results. These instabilities arise because the macromodel actually
represents an active, energyproducing network. It would be better for
an interconnect model to be totally passive, never generating energy on
its own. In this talk, we discuss the instability problem by appealing
to certain classical techniques of passive circuit synthesis. It is
shown that AWE is mathematically equivalent to the development of a
ladder circuit that realizes the Pade' approximation in virtual
"hardware." For certain classes of circuits and certain pairs of
input/output responses, the ladder realization consists entirely of
positivevalued circuit elements; as a consequence, it is guaranteed to
be passive and stable.

	The conditions under which Pade' approximation can be expected to
produce stable results will be discussed. Also, the limitations of Pade'
approximation will be described: for certain types of circuits and
responses, there is simply no guarantee that stable results can be
found. To overcome these problems, it is necessary to replace Pade'
approximation by other efficient algorithms for finding loworder
models. Fortunately, the notion of synthesizing a passive model can be
extended to more general classes of circuits. We will conclude the talk
by describing some promising new approaches to interconnect analysis
based upon this idea.
