<paragraph>In the coming decades, man will probably send robots to explore the solar
system.  In particular, we envision the need for mobile robots that can
navigate, map, and acquire samples on another planet, such as Mars.  To
perform these tasks in such isolated and uncertain environments, the robots
must be highly reliable and fairly autonomous.</paragraph>

<paragraph>The CMU Planetary Rover project has built the Ambler, a highly mobile and
energy efficient sixlegged walking robot.  Integrating the component
technologies of planning, perception and realtime control, we have
developed a system that autonomously walks the Ambler over rugged terrain.
The talk will describe research results in realtime control of many degrees
of freedom, perception of rugged terrain using a laser rangefinder, and
gait, footfall, and legrecovery planning.  The components are integrated
using the distributed Task Control Architecture (TCA), which supports
concurrent planning, execution, monitoring, and error recovery.  The talk
will describe our integration efforts and the strategies employed for
ensuring reliable and competent performance of the Ambler.</paragraph>
