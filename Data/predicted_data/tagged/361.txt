<paragraph>PART 1:
		    BEZIERMINKOWSKI METAMORPHOSIS
		     (joint work with Anil Kaul)</paragraph>

<paragraph>The interpolation between two solids offers a new tool for designing
and modifying shapes and an intuitive metaphor for specifying and
animating deforming shapes as the metamorphosis between a startsolid
and a different endsolid. Previously known techniques for computing
and animating such interpolations have required extensive user input,
have been limited in their domain, or have been too slow for
interactive use. We present a new technique that automatically
computes a parameterized family of shapes which interpolate arbitrary
start and endpolyhedra. The user needs only specify the relative
orientation of the two solids, which need not be convex or
starshaped, nor have the same number of faces. We have extended the
above technique to offer easy to use additional control over the
 deformation: besides the starting and ending solids, the new Bezier
 Interpolating Polyhedron (BIP) provides the possibility of specifying
 additional control polyhedra which influence the intermediate shape of
 the deforming object, while still preserving the boundary conditions
 defined by the start and endsolid. The representation of such a
 deforming object is formulated mathematically as a point describing a
 Bezier curve in the space of all polyhedra. We replace, in the Bezier
 formulation, the traditional control points by arbitrary control
 polyhedra and the vector addition by the Minkowski sum. BIPs are
 composed of Animated GRaphic ELement (AGRELs), which are faces with
 constant orientation, but with parameterized vertices represented by
 Bezier curves. AGRELs were designed to efficiently support smooth
 realtime animation on commercially available rendering hardware. We
 provide a tested algorithm for automatically computing BIPs from the
 sequence of arbitrary control polyhedra and demonstrate its
 applications to animation and design.</paragraph>

<paragraph>PART 2:
                   INTERACTIVE GEOMETRIC MODELING</paragraph>

<paragraph>Increased compute power and emerging graphics capabilities available
in commercial workstations make it possible to extend the interactive
Computer Aided Design from 2D drafting to the design of 3D shapes,
to the direct manipulation of assembly components, and to the
animation of motions and deformations. Furthermore, traditional
offline raycasting and hiddenlines removal techniques are being
replaced with hardwareassisted realtime engineering visualization for
inspecting complex models and their internal structures.</paragraph>

<paragraph>The speaker will overview several ongoing projects in the Interactive
Geometric Modeling group at IBM Research and will illustrate them with
video segments.
  Space deformations that interpolate multiple pointdisplacement
constraints have been used by P. Borrel, D. Bechmann, and A. Rappoport
to provide an interactive environment for editing ("sculpting")
freeform shapes and for animating their deformations.
  ABCSG, a hypertext, directmanipulation frontend for solid
modeling, was developed by M. van Emmerik, A. Rappoport, and J.
<sentence><sentence><speaker>Ross</speaker>ignac. </sentence> </sentence> It combines gesturedriven assembly construction for rapid
prototyping with precise dimensioning for final product definition.
  Programmable capabilities of highend graphics rasterizers
have been used by B. Schneider, A. Megahed, and J. <speaker>Ross</speaker>ignac to provide
realtime support for inspecting the internal structures of
mechanical assemblies via usercontrolled cutout volumes,
and for detecting and visualizing interferences.
  Automatic geometric compressions and 3D clustering are used by
P. Borrel, J. Mittleman, and J. <speaker>Ross</speaker>ignac to construct spatial
hierarchies and solid approximations with variable levels of details.
These are used to drastically improve graphics performance while
viewing complex scenes or detailed assembly models. Solid
approximations are performed from triangulated shapes obtained by
efficient triangulation algorithms developed by R. Ronfard and J.
<sentence><sentence><speaker>Ross</speaker>ignac. </sentence> </sentence> <sentence>Triboxes, developed by A. Crosnier and J. </sentence> <speaker>Ross</speaker>ignac, are
used to approximate background clusters.
  LAMBADA, an interactive animation editor, developed by J.
Mastrogiulio, P. Borrel, J. Kim, and J. <speaker>Ross</speaker>ignac, provides an
objectoriented architecture based on hierarchical assembly graphs with
screwbased motionlinks an parameterized (animated) objectleaves.</paragraph>
