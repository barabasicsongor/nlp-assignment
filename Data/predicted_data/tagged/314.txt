 Title: Learning to Understand Information on the Internet.

<paragraph>The explosive growth in the number and diversity of information
sources on the Internet is rapidly outstripping our ability to find
what we want.  Browsers and Indexing tools are practical, but only
partial, solutions to this problem.  A number of information gathering
agents have emerged.  However, because such agents require a
programmer to hand code a model of each information source in their
repertoire, they too are victims of information explosion.  This talk
explores automatically learning models of information sources as a
possible solution.</paragraph>

<paragraph>I will describe ILA, a domainindependent program that learns the
meaning of external information by explaining it in terms of internal
categories.  In one experiment, ILA starts off with knowledge of local
faculty members, quickly learns a model of the Internet service WHOIS,
and then bootstraps to learn models of the personnel directories
available at Berkeley, Brown, CalTech, Cornell, Rice, Rutgers, and
UCI.  ILA's hypothesis language is firstorder conjunctions, and its
bias is compactly encoded as a determination.  I introduce a
probabilistic model of ILA that bounds its sample complexity, and show
when this bound is tighter than the famous Haussler bound.</paragraph>

<paragraph>This talk is based on joint work with Mike Perkowitz</paragraph>
