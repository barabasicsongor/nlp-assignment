 SPEAKER:  Robert Cavalier (CMU Ethics Center)
 TOPIC: Redesigning the Classroom: Teaching and Technology
 	in Higher Education

 ABSTRACT: Not since the introduction of chalkboards in the 1800s has
 the classroom been so challenged in regard to its basic design and
 pedagogical setting.  Neither overhead transparencies nor TV monitors
 provide the kind of dynamic, interactive capabilities seen on today's
 high resolution monitors.  Indeed, it is precisely the evolutionary
 symbiosis of powerful computers and good software that today provides
 the first real challenge to the traditional classroom setting.  The
 presentation will discuss all aspects of educational computing as it
is currently evolving: its history and context, issues of
instructional design and evaluation, technical support and
administrative advocacy, and the "computational turn" that is
affecting every academic discipline.  Concrete examples from Dr.
Cavalier's classes at Carnegie Mellon will conclude the presentation.
These examples include the use of interactive multimedia, a hypertext
syllabus to display and disseminate classroom materials, a
classspecific electronic bulletin board, and the potential
utilization of "Teleprofs" via networkbased video mail.
