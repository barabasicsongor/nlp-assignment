 AARON: In Living Color.

<paragraph>During the past four years, work on the AARON program has been directed
primarily to giving it the ability to color its own drawings, and most
recently to providing it with a painting machine with which it could do
so in the real world. </paragraph>

<paragraph>Harold Cohen discusses some of the issues that have arisen in this
task; for example, the problem of mapping the results of working in
a threecolor additive system to a real world ncolor subtractive 
system. AARON makes its debut in color at the Computer Museum in Boston
on April 1, and Cohen assesses the degree to which the task has been 
accomplished.</paragraph>
