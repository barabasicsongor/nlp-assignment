	Logical Interpretations and Computational Simulations
			   Tim Griffin
      		      AT&T Bell Laboratories

	There are many examples in the literature of mathematical 
	logic concerning the interpretation of one logical system 
	in another. From a perspective informed by the 
	formulaeastypes correspondence, it is natural to 
	investigate logical interpretations from a computational 
	point of view.     Of particular interest are logical 
	interpretations that can be associated with simulations 
	of one computational system in another. 

	The talk surveys several results of this kind, including 
	interpretations of classical logic in constructive logic 
	that can be associated with ``continuation passing style'' 
	transformations. These transformations simulate a functional 
	language extended with control operators in a purely 
	functional language.
