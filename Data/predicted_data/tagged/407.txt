Abstract: 

  <paragraph>SCS will sponsor a seminar on ways to achieve a healthy
office environment at 1 p.m. Wednesday, May 12th, in Wean
Hall 5409.
  The speaker will be Karlis Mateus, a representative of
Steelcase, Inc., the office equipment manufacturer.  He will
focus on the ways in which poorly designed office furniture
can contribute to carpal tunnel syndrome and other illnesses.</paragraph>

  I have asked Mr. Mateus to keep the discussion as generic as
possible.  However, I do anticipate he will use some illustrations
of Steelcase products during his presentation.
