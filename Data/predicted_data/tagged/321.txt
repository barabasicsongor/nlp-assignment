<paragraph>This paper estimates household reaction to the implemenation of a
volumebased pricing program for the collecion of residential garbage. 
We gather original data on weight and volume of weekly garbage and
recycling of 75 households in Charlottesville, Virgina, both before and
after the implementation of a program which requires an eightycent
sticker on each bag of garbage.  <sentence>This data set is the first of its kind. </sentence>
 We estimate household demands for the collection of garbage and
recyclable material, the effect on the density of household garbage,
and the amount of illegal dumping conducted by housholds.  We also employ
a basic probit model to estimate the probability that a househod chooses
each of several methods available to reduce their garbage.</paragraph>

<paragraph>In response to the implementation of this volumebased pricing program,
we find that households (1) reduced the weight of their garbage by
14.0, (2) reduced the volume of garbage by 37.0 and (3) increased the
weight of their recyclable materials by 15.7.  We estimate that
additional illegal  or at least suspicious  disposal accounts for
0.486 pounds per week per person in Charlottesville, or 32 of the total
reduction in garbage observed at the curb.</paragraph>
