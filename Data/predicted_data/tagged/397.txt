Abstract: 

<paragraph>This talk is the next in a series of live, interactive video conferences
that will be held every Wednesday 7 pm  <etime>8:30 pm</etime> between January 20 and
May 5 1993.  These conferences are being organized by a few west coast
schools, hence the name, the West Coast Colloquium.  This will be something
of a multiple university distinguished speakers series.  The participants,
so far, are Berkeley, Stanford, Washington, UCLA, UC San Diego, UC Santa
Barbara, and us.
<sentence>The technology is Picturetel based with conference bridging by AT&T. </sentence>  There
will be multiple monitors at each site;  cameras at every site are voice
activated to force the display to show that site, so that the distributed
audience can have camera time to ask questions.</paragraph>

<sentence>Wednesday's seminars are still experiemental. </sentence>  Many sites have yet to
get all the equipment working for such an ambitious conference call.
Even if everything is working well, there will be a noticeable lag
between your speech and its broadcast to your and others' monitors.
