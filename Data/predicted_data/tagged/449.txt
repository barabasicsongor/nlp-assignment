 The New Computer and Communication Industry

<paragraph>Steve McGeady
Intel Corporation</paragraph>

<paragraph>We have been bombarded lately with breathless reports about an "Information
Superhighway" coming soon to your home.  But experts can't seem to agree on
what devices will connect your home or office to the InfoBahn, what services
will be offered on it, or what business and technical form this information
revolution will take.  Intel is at the heart of an industry that has
delivered a 1000fold increase in computing power over the last 15 years,
and Intel's Media Delivery Lab now charting a course to integrate the
personal computer with the rapidlyincreasing communication bandwidth now
being made available to enable new applications in the office and at home.
Mr. McGready will outline the history of the shift in the computer industry,
analyze the ongoing and impending shifts in the communications industry, and
highlight Architecture Labs and Intel's Media Delivery Lab.</paragraph>
